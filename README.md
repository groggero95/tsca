# Timing-Side-Channel-Attack

This project has been developed as a semester project during our studies at EURECOM, Sophia Antipholis (Fall 2018 - Spring 2019), with the supervision of Prof. Renaud Pacalet.

## Goal
The purpose of this project is to understand how it is possible, knowing the algorithm, to retrieve either the inputs or the outputs knowing the other counterparts. At the very beginning, we developed our own algorithm, running on a bare metal Zybo board which has an ARM-architecture CPU.
